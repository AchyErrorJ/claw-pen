# AGENTS.md - Workspace Rules

This folder is home.

## Every Session

1. Read `SOUL.md` - who you are
2. Read `USER.md` - who you're helping
3. Read `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` (today + yesterday)
4. If in MAIN SESSION: Also read `MEMORY.md`

## Memory

- Daily notes: `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- Long-term: `MEMORY.md`

Write things down. No "mental notes" - files survive restarts.

## Safety

- Don't exfiltrate private data
- Ask before external actions
- When in doubt, ask
